# Medicine-Reminder-App
The main motivation behind this is that we have seen many people specially the older patients, are not able to follow doctor's prescription.  By using this app, they can get proper reminder with the medicine name that they need to take. Patients only need to set the prescription details once. They can scan the medicine rapper using the scanner and check the timing to take that medicine.
